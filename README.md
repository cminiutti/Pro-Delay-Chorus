# Pro-Delay-Chorus
### NOTE: This plugin is under construction and does not reflect a finalized product.

## Description
Building on the ideas and algorithms used in previous Delay and Chorus/Flanger projects, this new plugin features advanced design techniques which focus on modularity, object-oriented programming principles, the D.R.Y principle, readability, reusability, and efficiency. 

The Pro Delay/Chorus project cleanly organizes the plug-in architecture by packaging all DSP code into individual modules to support easy signal-chain reconfiguration and by formatting the UI in a manner that allows adjustments to be made simply without having to change multiple lines throughout the project. These considerations also provide a great aid to the debugging process.

(**NOTE**: *For the time being, please refer to previous repository READMEs for descriptions on the algorithms used in this plugin*)
